# Used-Car-Regression-
In part 1 of the project, I cleaned and analyzed the data to predict the selling price of used cars. I obtained an interpretable polynomial model with 7 variables. I also obtained a random forest. The results indicate that there is a region of the data set (which contains roughly 25% of the data) in which the predictions are much less accurate. To solve this issue, in part 2 of the project I scraped the original price of the car models when they were new, and using this new variable I improved the predictions from part 1.
